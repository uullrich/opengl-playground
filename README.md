# UweÂ´s OpenGL Playground

This is my personal OpenGL playground, where I try to get used to anything related to OpenGL. Maybe a little bit motivated by some game developers at twicht.

I only develop under macos for this playground, therefore the toolchain is only optimized for macos.

## Things I implemented so far:
- CMake build system which loads me some basic libraries to create a OpenGL Window with a proper environment, texture loading library and a math library.
- Basic fragment and vertex shaders which keeps my stuff running.
- Basic 2D Camera (ortographic)
- TextureRenderer
- Entity
